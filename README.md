# My portfolio website assignment

## One possible version of my future portfolio website

- I have built this website as a starting point to my portfolio.
- **Mobile view:**

- **Desktop view**:

- purpose of this project - to practice CSS: flexbox, grid, make them work together.
- when user hovers over navigation and Github link, the text gets underlined.
- when navigation link is clicked, it takes user to relevant section.
- when Resume link is clicked, it takes user to my Github site(it opens in new window) where user can download my Resume PDF file.
- when user mouse hovers over project tile, it gives impression the card is lifted.
- when user clicks on the project card, it takes to external website, link opens in new window.
- when user clicks on GitHub link in contact section, it opens in new window ant takes to my GitHub page. 

## My observation
- what I learned that it is worth to take time in the beginning and plan how I will achieve the desired results, which properties I will use.
-  when building next similar project, it is worth to start coding from mobile view first, and desktop after.
