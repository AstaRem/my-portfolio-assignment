    ![Tablet view](img-readme/Tablet3.png)
    
- **Desktop view**:
    ![Desktop view](img-readme/Desktop1.png)
    ![Desktop view](img-readme/Desktop2.png)
    ![Desktop view](img-readme/Desktop3.png)


- purpose of this project - to practice CSS: flexbox, grid, make them work together.
- what I learned that it is worth to take time in the beginning and plan how I will achieve the desired results, which properties I will use.
-  when building next similar project, it is worth to start coding from mobile view first, and desktop after.
